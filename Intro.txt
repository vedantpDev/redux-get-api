Why we need to learn Redux ?
=> We USe Redux for State Management.(Purpose Of the Redux) 
=> (Prop Drilling) in React we pass data by the prop through the components to components.
=> To solve this problem we use Redux.

=> TO solve this problem we use "Redux Store".
when we store the whole application state and we use data from this storage.

=> Redux helps you manage "global" state - state that is needed across many parts of your application.

==> What is Redux?
=> Redux is Pattern and library  for managing and updating "application state"
using events called "actions". it serves as a centralized store for state that
need to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be 
updated in a predictable fashion.

==> TODO: IMP Topics Of Redux
1} Action => What to do ?
=> Actions are plain Javascript objects that have a type field.
=> Actions only tell what to do, but dont tell hoe to do.
1.1} Action Creator
=> Pure Function which creates an action. => Reusable, Portable, Easy to Test

2} Reduser => How to do ?
=> Reduser are function that take the "current state" and an "action" as arguments,
and return a "new state" result.

3} Store => Object which holds the state of the apllication.
=> The Redux store brings together the "state", "actions" and "reducers" that make up your app.
=> its important to note that you'll only have a "single store" in a Redux Appliction.
=> Every Redux store has a "single root" reducer function.

4} Function associated with Store => createStore() 
                                    dispacth(action)

 The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object.
